## 🌟 Overview

Real-world data is represented in both structured (e.g., graph connections) and unstructured (e.g., textual, visual information) formats, encompassing complex relationships that include explicit links (such as social connections and user behaviors) and implicit interdependencies among semantic entities, often illustrated through knowledge graphs. In this work, we propose GraphAgent, an automated agent pipeline that addresses both explicit graph dependencies and implicit graph-enhanced semantic inter-dependencies, aligning with practical data scenarios for predictive tasks (e.g., node classification) and generative tasks (e.g., text generation). GraphAgent comprises three key components: (i) a Graph Generator Agent that builds knowledge graphs to reflect complex semantic dependencies; (ii) a Task Planning Agent that interprets diverse user queries and formulates corresponding tasks through agentic self-planning; and (iii) a Task Execution Agent that efficiently executes planned tasks while automating tool matching and invocation in response to user queries. These agents collaborate seamlessly, integrating language models with graph language models to uncover intricate relational information and data semantic dependencies. Through extensive experiments on various graph-related predictive and text generative tasks on diverse datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphAgent across various settings.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Invoking GraphAgent (Inference)
#### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GraphAgent.git
cd GraphAgent

# Create a conda environment
conda create -n graphagent python=3.11
conda activate graphagent

# Install requirements for GraphAgent inference
pip install -r GraphAgent-inference/requirements.txt
```

#### Get Pre-trained Models

We provide several pre-trained checkpoints on 🤗 Hugging Face to power the full potential of GraphAgent:

- `GraphAgent/GraphAgent-8B`: Graph action model for GraphAgent as a multimodal llama3 that can take graph tokens as input.
- `GraphAgent/GraphTokenizer`: A multimodal graph-text tokenizer for tokenizing graphs into continuous tokens.
- `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`: The sentence transformer for text graph embedding.

You can download these checkpoints to a local dir and replace them in `GraphAgent-inference/run.sh`. Or, the program would also automatically download them for you.

#### Set the Planner and API Token

We utilize API-based LLM calls for task planning and graph generation. The default planner here is `deepseek`, where you can find in `GraphAgent-inference/run.sh`. Put your API key in 
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```
that is corresponding to the planner.

#### Inference Examples

```bash
bash GraphAgent-inference/run.sh

>>> Please enter a user instruction or file path (or type 'exit' to quit):

# use GraphAgent-inference/demo/use_cases/teach_me_accelerate.txt as an example
>>> Please enter a user instruction or file path (or type 'exit' to quit): GraphAgent-inference/demo/use_cases/teach_me_accelerate.txt
```

Then you will have a close look on how GraphAgent works to achieve your task.

<!-- ## 📖 Documentation

### Model Inference


```python
# Load specific model variant
model = GraphAgent.from_pretrained("graphagent-base")
```

#### Input Formats

GraphAgent supports multiple input formats:
- NetworkX graphs
- PyTorch Geometric Data objects
- DGL graphs
- Edge list formats

```python
# Using NetworkX
import networkx as nx
G = nx.random_geometric_graph(200, 0.125)
result = model.predict(G)

# Using edge lists
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
result = model.predict_from_edges(edges)
``` -->
