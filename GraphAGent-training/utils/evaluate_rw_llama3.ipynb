Title: Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding. Abstract: We present BlockBERT, a lightweight and efficient BERT model for better\\nmodeling long-distance dependencies. Our model extends BERT by introducing\\nsparse block structures into the attention matrix to reduce both memory\\nconsumption and training/inference time, which also enables attention heads to\\ncapture either short- or long-range contextual information. We conduct\\nexperiments on language model pre-training and several benchmark question\\nanswering datasets with various paragraph lengths. BlockBERT uses 18.7-36.1%\\nless memory and 12.0-25.1% less time to learn the model. During testing,\\nBlockBERT saves 27.8% inference time, while having comparable and sometimes\\nbetter prediction accuracy, compared to an advanced BERT-based model, RoBERTa..

Title: Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code. Abstract: We introduce Codex, a GPT language model fine-tuned on publicly available\\ncode from GitHub, and study its Python code-writing capabilities. A distinct\\nproduction version of Codex powers GitHub Copilot. On HumanEval, a new\\nevaluation set we release to measure functional correctness for synthesizing\\nprograms from docstrings, our model solves 28.8% of the problems, while GPT-3\\nsolves 0% and GPT-J solves 11.4%.

Title: Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers. Abstract: Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence\\nmodeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from\\nquadratic compute and memory requirements with respect to sequence length.\\nSuccessful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local\\nsliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work\\nproposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating\\ncomputation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest.\\nThis work builds upon two lines of research: it combines the modeling\\nflexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency\\ngains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the\\nRouting Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based\\non online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to\\n$O\\\\left(n^{1.5}d\\\\right)$ from $O\\\\left(n^2d\\\\right)$ for sequence length $n$ and\\nhidden dimension $d$. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse\\nattention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity)\\nas well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while\\nusing fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art\\non the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with\\na 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192..

However, the quadratic growth in time and memory complexity with increasing sequence length has been a major limitation. To address this issue, several efficient transformer variants have been proposed. For example, BlockBERT (@CITE[1]@) introduces sparse block structures into the attention matrix to reduce memory consumption and training/inference time. Similarly, Sparse Transformers (@CITE[2]@) use sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the complexity to O(n sqrt{n}). Big Bird (@CITE[3]@) proposes a sparse attention mechanism that reduces the quadratic dependency on sequence length to linear. Adaptive Attention Span (@CITE[4]@) allows the model to learn its optimal attention span, enabling the extension of the maximum context size. Compressive Transformers (@CITE[6]@) compress past memories to facilitate learning across extensive sequences. These efficient transformer variants have achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks, including language modeling, image generation, and code generation.'}]}],\n",
       " 'ground_truth': '\\n\\nOur HNet based approach is based on the architecture in (@CITE[4]@ which uses it to edit factual knowledge in LMs. While the architecture is similar, we use the HNet to encode task-specific instructions and is intended for controlling task-level LM behavior unlike the micro-behavior targeted in (@CITE[4]@. Similar to ours and (@CITE[4]@, Bayesian hyper networks (Krueger et al., 2018) linearizes the number of parameters for predictions by constraining the HNet outputs to scale and shift parameters.

We use the same dataset and training settings as Tk-Instruct but instead use the pretrained BART model (@CITE[2]@ as it is task agnostic compared to T5. In addition, we enhance this model with meta-learning and consider significantly different training, evaluation, and model settings to test zero-shot generalization resulting in unique contributions and conclusions orthogonal to the findings in (@CITE[5]@.\\nReferences:ID: 1.
